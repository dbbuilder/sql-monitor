## Where Competitors Excel

### AWS RDS Advantages

- ‚úÖ **Fully Managed**: Zero infrastructure maintenance
- ‚úÖ **Enhanced Monitoring**: 1-second granularity
- ‚úÖ **Performance Insights**: ML-based bottleneck detection (2025)

**Our Gap**: We require manual maintenance (SQL Agent jobs), slower collection (5 minutes)

---

### Redgate Monitor Advantages

- ‚úÖ **ML-Based Alerting**: Dynamic thresholds (v14.0.37+)
- ‚úÖ **Integrated Index Maintenance**: Automated defragmentation
- ‚úÖ **Commercial Support**: Dedicated team, phone support

**Our Gap**: Alerting is less sophisticated (2/5 vs. 5/5), no integrated maintenance

---

## Decision Guide

### Choose **Our Solution** If:

- ‚úÖ Budget is limited ($0-$1,500 vs. $11,640 vs. $27,000-$37,000)
- ‚úÖ Developers need SSMS integration (code preview, launcher, deep linking)
- ‚úÖ You want Grafana visualization power
- ‚úÖ No cloud lock-in is required (hybrid/multi-cloud)
- ‚úÖ Open source foundation is preferred
- ‚úÖ Team has Docker and SQL Server skills

**ROI**: **Infinite** (zero cost) to **10,400%** (vs. AWS RDS)

---

### Choose **AWS RDS** If:

- ‚úÖ Already committed to AWS ecosystem
