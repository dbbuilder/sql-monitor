# USG_GetEspLdcAcctLatestProjections Performance Fix - Executive Summary

**Date:** 2025-10-29
**Priority:** 🔥 CRITICAL
**Status:** ✅ Solution Ready for Deployment
**Impact:** Production timeout issue affecting 491 executions per 4 hours

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

### Current Production Issue

**Stored Procedure:** `USG_GetEspLdcAcctLatestProjections`

**Performance Metrics:**
- ⏱️ **Execution Time:** 5-7 minutes (frequently times out at 30 seconds)
- 💾 **Disk I/O:** 11,000,000 pages (87 GB) read per query
- 🔄 **Query Frequency:** 491 executions per 4 hours (~3,000/day)
- ⚠️ **Timeout Rate:** 25-30% of queries fail
- 📊 **Wait Type:** PAGEIOLATCH_SH (disk bottleneck)

**Worst Case Example (2025-10-29 16:10:05):**
- Duration: 308 seconds (5.1 minutes)
- Disk reads: 11,184,709 pages (87 GB)
- Blocked by concurrent backup job (65 minutes)
- Session: 196, User: arctradeprodrunner

**Business Impact:**
- **Daily cumulative query time:** 248 hours wasted
- **Infrastructure cost:** High I/O charges (~$500-$1,000/month)
- **User experience:** 5+ minute waits, frequent timeouts
- **Correlation:** Issue worsens during backup windows (I/O contention)

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

### Technical Issue

```sql
-- ❌ ANTI-PATTERN: Row-by-row execution
CROSS APPLY USG_fnGetProjectionsLatestV2(mc.USG_Meter_Channel_ID, @espBeId) prj
    -- This function is called ONCE per meter channel
    -- If 2,000 channels match, function runs 2,000 times
    -- Each call does a table scan on 409 million row table
```

**Why This is Slow:**
1. Function executes **2,000 times** (once per meter channel)
2. Each function call **table scans** `USG_Projected_Usage_Interval` (409M rows, 164 GB)
3. Nested function `USG_FnGetEspProjectionVersion` adds **2,000 more operations**
4. **Total:** 4,000+ table accesses = 11M page reads

**The Math:**
```
2,000 meter channels
  × 1 function call per channel (CROSS APPLY)
  × 5,500 pages per function call (table scan)
  × 1 nested function per call (USG_FnGetEspProjectionVersion)
  = 11,000,000 pages read
  = 87 GB disk I/O
  = 5+ minutes with PAGEIOLATCH_SH waits
```

**Table Statistics (From Production):**
- Table: `USG_Projected_Usage_Interval`
- Rows: **409,235,729** (409 million)
- Size: **167,927 MB** (164 GB)
- Growth: ~10M rows/month

---

## ✅ Solution Overview

### Three-Part Optimization

#### 1. Eliminate CROSS APPLY (Set-Based Query)

**Replace:** Row-by-row function calls
**With:** Single INNER JOIN with inlined logic

```sql
-- ❌ BEFORE: 2,000 function calls
CROSS APPLY USG_fnGetProjectionsLatestV2(mc.USG_Meter_Channel_ID, @espBeId) prj

-- ✅ AFTER: Single set-based operation
INNER JOIN dbo.USG_Projected_Usage_Interval pmui
    ON pmui.USG_Meter_Channel_ID = mc.USG_Meter_Channel_ID
    AND pmui.[Version] = CASE ... END  -- Inlined version logic
    AND pmui.Flow_Date >= @startDate   -- NEW: Date filter
    AND pmui.Flow_Date <= @endDate
```

#### 2. Create Enhanced Covering Index

**Current Index:** `IX_Projected_Usage_Channel_Version_ESP`
- Keys: USG_Meter_Channel_ID, Version, ESP_BE_ID
- ❌ Missing: Flow_Date (critical for date filtering)
- ❌ Missing: INCLUDE clause (forces key lookups)

**New Index:** `IX_Projected_Usage_Channel_Version_ESP_Enhanced`
- Keys: USG_Meter_Channel_ID, Version, ESP_BE_ID, **Flow_Date** ✅
- INCLUDE: HE01-HE24, F01-F24, Projection_Cycle, Interval, etc. ✅
- Size: ~40-60 GB (compressed)
- Creation time: 2-3 hours

#### 3. Add Date Range Filter

**Default:** Last 30 days + next 30 days (60 days total)
- Reduces data volume by 80-90% (from 365+ days to 60 days)
- Optional parameters for custom date ranges
- Application can override defaults if needed

## ⚠️ Risks and Mitigations

### Risk #1: Index Creation Time (2-3 Hours)

**Mitigation:**
- Use ONLINE = ON option (minimal blocking)
- Schedule during lowest transaction window (2 AM - 5 AM)
- Monitor progress with provided query
- Can pause/resume if needed

### Risk #2: Disk Space Shortage

**Current Free Space Needed:** 100 GB minimum

**Mitigation:**
- Verify free space before starting (included in script)
- Archive old data if needed
- Use DATA_COMPRESSION = PAGE (saves 40-60% space)

### Risk #3: Different Results Between v1 and v2

**Mitigation:**
- Comprehensive test script compares result sets
- Side-by-side testing in TEST environment
- Gradual rollout (10% → 50% → 100%)
- v1 remains available for rollback

### Risk #4: Application Compatibility

**Mitigation:**
- v2 has same parameters as v1 (backward compatible)
- Added optional date range parameters (default to 60 days)
- No breaking changes to result set structure
- Gradual rollout allows easy rollback

## 🎓 Lessons Learned (Preventative)

### For Future Development

1. **Avoid CROSS APPLY with functions** on large tables (>1M rows)
   - Use INNER JOIN with inlined logic instead
   - SQL Server cannot optimize across function boundaries

2. **Always include date range filters** on time-series data
   - Reduces data volume by 80-90%
   - Critical for tables with 100M+ rows

3. **Create covering indexes** for frequently-run queries
   - Include all columns in SELECT clause
   - Eliminates key lookups (massive performance gain)

4. **Test with production-like data volumes**
   - 100 rows in DEV != 409 million rows in PROD
   - Performance issues often invisible in small datasets

5. **Monitor query performance proactively**
   - Alert when queries exceed 10 seconds
   - Investigate before users complain
   - Use Extended Events for timeout tracking
